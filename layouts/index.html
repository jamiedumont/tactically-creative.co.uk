				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<h3>We build fast, reliable &amp; secure websites that save businesses from the pitfalls of Wordpress</h3>

				<p>The web is a mess currently, and not the easiest place to build a business anymore. A decent site has probably never been more vital for a successful business, but they are, almost across the board, at their worst. The drive for complex, interactive sites that are content and media rich has caused sites to become slower, which cripples the user experience and degrades your business's communication.</p>

				<p>Seriously, forcing our smartphones to choke through painfully slow websites has become tiresome, and it's always a little disappointing when we can't read that awesome article that went viral; all because the site had gone down. A sub-standard website comes with some very real costs attached. If the damage done to people's perception of your business isn't incentive enough, maybe the impact on your bottom line is?</p>

				<h4>It's proven: <a target="_blank" href="https://blog.uptrends.com/posts/2014/05/08/Why-and-how-increasing-your-website-speed-can-drastically-increase-conversions-and-revenue">Faster websites increase revenue.</a></h4>

			<h2>Why Tactically Creative?</h2>

			<p>Tactically Creative came about when I recognised that small businesses and entrepreneurs spend way too much time and money getting even the simplest of websites online. Putting your ideas out there for the world to see should be exhilerating, but the process of building and managing a web presence with all of it's complexities has marred the experience.</p>

			<p>I'm Jamie, and with a small cast of rotating friends, I run Tactically Creative. We're based in London, and specialise in creating static sites and web apps for passionate people with great ideas.</p>

			<p>I value working closely with my clients, and like to build working relationships that are personal and long-lasting. I love seeing my clients succeed, and by allowing me to assist, I get to play a direct role in making that happen. That's the biggest privilege I know of! Whilst our work can provide immediate benefits, I don't subscribe to the notion of "quick fixes". Building something great takes time and patience, so I'm here for the long haul.</p>

			<h2>Why Static?</h2>

			<div class="speed one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_speed.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p class="center">
					Static sites are Roadrunner to Wordpress' Coyote. They'll always be faster and just one step ahead.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="security one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_secure.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>Is adding that plugin safe? Are you sure? You might have just invited hackers to your party. Never again on a static site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="reliability one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_reliable.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Reliability</h3>
				<p>With no moving parts to go wrong, a static site will ride the wave like a pro when you go viral.</p>
			</div>

		</div>

		<div class="content content--copy">
			<p>I build static sites because I truly believe they are superior, in nearly every way, to the dynamic alternatives and offer untold benefits for a business. I came to this conclusion after having spent years fighting with systems that never seemed to work <em>with</em> me, or <em>for</em> my clients. Your site shouldn't take up more time than actually running your business; it should just work. I aim to make your site an asset, not a source of frustration.</p>
