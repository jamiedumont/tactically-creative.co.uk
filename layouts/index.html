				<h2>Our Mission</h2>
				<h3>We build fast, reliable &amp; secure websites that save businesses from the pitfalls of Wordpress</h3>

				<p>The web is a mess currently, and not the easiest place to build a business anymore. A decent site has probably never been more vital for a successful business, but they are, almost across the board, at their worst. The drive for complex, interactive sites that are content and media rich has caused sites to become slower; which cripples the experience for so many users, and degrades your business' communication.</p>

				<p>Seriously, we're fed up of forcing our smartphones to choke through painfully slow websites, and are always a little disappointed when we can't read that awesome article that went viral; all because the site had gone down. A sub-standard website is bad for users, which means it's bad for business that runs it; and comes with a very real cost.</p>

			<h2>Why Static?</h2>

			<div class="speed one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_speed.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Speed</h3>
				<p class="center">
					Static sites are Roadrunner to Wordpress' Coyote. They'll always be faster and just one step ahead.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="security one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_secure.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Security</h3>
				<p>Is adding that plugin safe? Are you sure? You might have just invited hackers to your party. Never again on a static site.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="reliability one-third">
				<img src="/images/qtctc_asset_reliable.png" class="show-icon"alt="">
				<h3>Reliability</h3>
				<p>With no moving parts to go wrong, a static site will ride the wave like a pro when you go viral.</p>
			</div>


			<p>We build static sites because we truly believe they are superior, in nearly every way, to the dynamic alternatives and offer untold benefits for a business. We came to this conclusion after having spent years fighting with systems that never seemed to work for us, or our clients. Your site shouldn't take up more time than actually running your business; it should just work. We ensure that your site is an asset, not a source of frustration.</p>
