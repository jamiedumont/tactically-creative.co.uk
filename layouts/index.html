					<h3>Our Mission</h3>

					<p><strong>Build websites in an unconventional way to deliver complete peace of mind.</strong></p>

					<p>We saw that "Web Design" as a service is a little bit broken. Big businesses can manage an expensive, complex and time-consuming process, but smaller ones get excluded from access to professional services. We fix that problem, and tailor our services specifically for small businesses and entrepreneurs, who want the peace of mind and high performance that working with a professional brings.</p>

				</article>

				<article>

					<h3>Why Tactically Creative?</h3>

					<p>We've reimagined what a bespoke web design process should look like. The result is a process and set of tools that make it simple, powerful, affordable but importantly; fun to build your website.</p>

					<p>We want the process of putting your ideas out into the world to be exhilerating, and not marred by it's complexities or expense. The world increasingly belongs to brilliant thinkers starting their own ventures, not corporate enterprises; and we provide them the tools to take on the big boys!</p>

			<h2>Working with Us</h2>

			<h4>Objective-based Design</h4>

			<p>We believe in setting ambitious goals and then knocking them down one-by-one. By breaking down big tasks into smaller cycles of work, we stay focussed on the desired result.</p>

			<p>Working this way allows us to test our ideas and strategies, and back our decisions with solid data. Objective-based Design ensures our clarity of vision remains unhindered.</p>
