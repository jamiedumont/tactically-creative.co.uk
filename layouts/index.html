			<h2>Our Mission</h2>
			<h3>We build fast, reliable &amp; secure websites that save businesses from the pitfalls of Wordpress</h3>

			<p>Building a site for your business is time-consuming, costly and frankly confusing if you use the 'industry standard' tools. After years working with systems like Wordpress, we've got little respect for the "standards". We believe they are outdated, restrictive and costly in so many ways.</p>

			<p>We've reimagined what a bespoke web design process should look like. The result is a process and set of tools that make it simple, powerful, affordable but importantly; fun to build a website that allows you to focus on growing your business.</p>

			<!-- <a href="">The benefits of working with us</a> -->
			<h2>Why Tactically Creative?</h2>

			<p>Tactically Creative exists because we saw that "Web Design" as a service is a little bit broken. Big businesses can manage the shortcomings of an expensive, complex and time-consuming process, but smaller ones get excluded from access to professional services. We fix that problem, and tailor our services specifically for small business and entrepreneurs, who want the peace of mind and high performance that working with a professional brings.</p>

			<p>We want the process of putting your ideas out into the world to be exhilerating, and not marred by it's complexities or expense. The world increasingly belongs to brilliant thinkers starting their own ventures, not corporate enterprises; and we provide them the tools to take on the big boys!</p>

			<p>Oh, and we're a small company just like you...</p>
