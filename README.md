# Tactically Creative Public Website
> Site for web design & development company, Tactically Creative.

## Project Description
This site serves as the primary site for TC's services, along with their blog.

## Tools Used
- Hugo (static-site generator)
- Bourbon Neat framework (CSS/SCSS)
- Codekit (handling concatenation and minification of assets)

## Local development
Local development requires Codekit & Hugo.

## Deployment
Static site can be hosted anywhere, but currently sits behind nginx on a Digital Ocean droplet

## Future Development
Site will be ported to Statamic when regular publishing becomes a priority. Hugo is an excellent static-site generator, but it makes content management from iOS devices largely impossible. A move to a more robust CMS with control panel will allow for easier content management.
