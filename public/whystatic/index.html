<h2 id="tl-dr:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">TL;DR</h2>

<p>In short, static sites are fast, lightweight, reliable and they scale well. They are more secure, simple to maintain and they allow you to focus all your time and effort on the site&rsquo;s user interface and content. Often, this dedication really shows and places a truly powerful asset at your business&rsquo; disposal.</p>

<p>The biggest problem is allowing non-technical people a method of updating static sites&hellip;so we fixed that too!</p>

<p>Static sites are a much better <strong>asset</strong> to your business than Wordpress ever could be.</p>

<h2 id="why-serve-your-users-static-web-pages:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Why serve your users static web pages?</h2>

<p>Ultimately, we believe that investing in a static website proves itself worthwhile in every possible way. It&rsquo;s inherent traits mean that we can deliver a website that doesn&rsquo;t distract you from running your business. It allows you to concentrate your efforts on growing and developing, not treading water and maintaining the status quo.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s easy to get sucked into the pro/con debate of all of your choices when building a website. There&rsquo;s so many options it&rsquo;s almost paralysing. Fortunately, static sites make a strong case for themselves in a few key areas. Namely:</p>

<ul>
<li>Speed</li>
<li>Reliability</li>
<li>Security</li>
<li>Flexibility</li>
<li>Efficiency (Return on Investment)</li>
</ul>

<p>Avoiding excessive detail, here&rsquo;s the reasons why we believe a static solution is best for your growing business.</p>

<h3 id="speed:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Speed</h3>

<p>To be frank, static sites are faster than any dynamic site; purely due to their simplicity. They are lightweight in nature, and can be easily delivered on a cost-effective worldwide platform at incredible speeds.</p>

<p>Speed is really easy to underestimate, but the use of mobile data connections, mobile phones and a shortening of people&rsquo;s attention spans makes your sites loading speed one of the most important metrics to keep an eye on. Many studies have witnessed a very strong and direct correlation between loading speeds and important metrics such as bounce rates, conversion rates and even your revenue.</p>

<p><strong>insert 5 facts from studies</strong></p>

<p>Whether you choose static or not, speed needs to be one of your core considerations from the very beginning!</p>

<h3 id="reliability:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Reliability</h3>

<p>This is our favourite reason for going static, as it give us and our clients ultimate peace of mind.</p>

<p>Taking advantage of static site&rsquo;s inherent simplicity means that we can easily, and cost-effectively provide a very resilient platform for your site. The platform we&rsquo;ve chosen keeps your site running on multiple servers worldwide. Not only does this increase the speed of the site to all users, but it provides total redundancy. If one server goes down; another automatically takes its place. The result? Your site will always be open for business.</p>

<p>Redundancy is good, but stopping servers going down in the first place seems like a better idea. A static site is more resilient to traffic surges; meaning that when your site suddenly goes viral, it&rsquo;s prepared to deal with the onslaught of new customers that will come pouring in the front door! How often do you click that trending link on Twitter, only to find an error message stating: &ldquo;This page is unavailable&rdquo;, because their server buckled under the pressure?</p>

<h3 id="security:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Security</h3>

<p>Everyone&rsquo;s data is digital these days, and dynamic sites that aren&rsquo;t kept secure offer the many villains of the internet a chance to cause mayhem. By inserting malicious code into the pages of your website, without you even knowing, these hackers can bring your site to it&rsquo;s knees. This extra code might do something as simple as add content to your business&rsquo; website that would harm it&rsquo;s reputation (think images and links to some darker corners of the web), or something far more devious such as monitoring and recording your user&rsquo;s activity and data! Quite often, they just delete or modify a few key files that cause the site to go down, and make finding the issue very difficult and time-consuming to resolve.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>73.2% of the most popular WordPress installations are vulnerable to known exploits which can be detected using free automated tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Static sites aren&rsquo;t totally immune to this sort of attack, but nothing is! However, with no moving parts, and no dynamic processes to interrupt; they often prove to be too much of a challenge for most hackers. Dynamic servers are an easy mark by comparison, and as with outrunning a bear; you don&rsquo;t have to be the fastest, just faster than the other guy&hellip;</p>

<h3 id="flexibility:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Flexibility</h3>

<p>Dynamic sites often require you to intricately weave your design and content very closely together, around the platform&rsquo;s own code; in order to provide you with an easy way of updating content on your site. We believe this approach greatly restricts your ability to change and modify the site in years to come, as your business grows. They require you to sacrifice long-term flexibility in order to have access to short-term ease.</p>

<p>We believe that you shouldn&rsquo;t have to make that compromise. Not only have we built an incredibly easy and intuitive way to keep your site current (something people wrongly assume can&rsquo;t be done on a static site); it&rsquo;s completely modular! We keep the platform, the design, your content and the editing interface all completely separate to allow your site to grow with you, not tie you down.</p>

<p>This allows you to update and change individual components of the site as you wish, making the website sustainable over a much longer lifetime than one large monolithic system. Do you really want to scrap your entire site every couple of years when it&rsquo;s time for a redesign? Of course you don&rsquo;t! Start building your website in a modular fashion and your outlay becomes a long-lived investment in the future of your business.</p>

<h3 id="efficiency:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">Efficiency</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Building a static site that is every bit as powerful as a CMS like Wordpress is not an easy undertaking. Creating such a powerful, yet simple result requires complex and intricate processes; with the considered thought rarely seen in a typical Wordpress setup. It places far more of a burden on us as developers, than any other system would; but we believe the beautiful efficiency it grants is worth it!</p>

<p>A static site provides incredible speed without requiring incredibly expensive servers to power it. It provides worldwide reliability because it&rsquo;s naturally lightweight and resilient, whilst keeping running costs low and mitigating the chance of expensive downtime. Security is inherent, meaning less time is spent worrying about attacks, and more time creating and delivering experiences that will delight your customers and grow your business. The modularity of a static site keeps it flexible, and ensures that your investment in your most important asset lasts for as long as possible.</p>

<p>Delivering all of this is a huge task for us, but the resulting site is far more efficient with both your money and you time! How valuable is that?</p>

<h2 id="what-actually-are-static-sites:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">What actually are &ldquo;static sites&rdquo;?</h2>

<p>To understand what they are, and how they offer all the benefits that they do; we need to understand a few fundamentals about websites. All web browsers (the thing you&rsquo;re reading this on right now!) understand just three languages, regardless of whether they are a supercomputer, a mobile phone or that crusty of PC you&rsquo;ve got sitting in the loft.</p>

<p>They can only understand files written as:
* HTML - for the structure and content of the page.
* CSS - for what that page looks like.
* Javascript (JS) - for how the page is animated and interacts with the user.</p>

<p>These are the standardised building blocks of the entire internet. Sites can exist with CSS and JS (but not look very pretty), but most utilise all three.</p>

<p>Regardless of what is going on behind the scenes to create these three types of files, even the most complicated sites such as Facebook, Amazon, Google, etc are reduced to just these three elements before being delivered to your screen.</p>

<h3 id="the-difference-between-static-dynamic:51226af1ae345d019c3087fd1d561cd1">The Difference Between Static &amp; Dynamic</h3>

<p>Static web pages are those consisting of just HTML, CSS and JS. They sit on a server waiting to be called and delivered to your screen in exactly the right format for your browser to understand and display. They are the &lsquo;end result&rsquo;, ready and waiting to go.</p>

<p>Dynamic web pages aren&rsquo;t quite so prepared. When you make a request to a server for a dynamic page, that &lsquo;end result&rsquo; doesn&rsquo;t actually exist yet. It exists only as a skeleton, with a list of parts needed to flesh it out. When the page is requested, the server consults the framework to discover what parts it needs for that particular page. It then sets about finding those parts, and replacing the framework with the proper content, piece by piece, until the entire framework of the page is now filled with the end content. Only now is it ready to send the page your requested to your browser!</p>

<p>Many of the drawback of sites based around dynamic web pages stem from this requirement to rebuild pages upon every request. There are ways to mitigate or reduce the effects, but static will always be faster, safer and more reliable; that&rsquo;s why it&rsquo;s our tool of choice.</p>
