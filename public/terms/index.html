<p>Whilst we would really rather go about our business without any terms &amp; conditions, we regrettably have to put some in place. If you feel any of the following prevent you from working with us, get in touch and we’ll talk about it. Any amendments to these T&amp;Cs must be made in advance and agreed upon in writing.</p>

<p>The following terms &amp; conditions apply to all services provided by Tactically Creative, and by ordering any of our services; you are agreeing to adhere to the following T&amp;C’s.</p>

<h3 id="1-contract-commencement:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">1 - Contract Commencement</h3>

<p>It is likely that some of our work together will occur before we agree on a suitable contract for our engagement. If any of this work is to be charged for, we will notify you before proceeding; and our temporary engagement shall be subject to all the terms and conditions listed below.</p>

<p>Once we have agreed the nature of our project together, a suitable contract shall be put in place detailing the parties subject to the contract, the work to be carried out, an estimated price, predicted completion dates and a payment schedule. It should be understood that any requests for changes or additions outside the original agreement shall be subject to a change order.</p>

<p>Any price estimates are valid for thirty days only, and all predicted completion dates shall be subject to change, based on when the project commenced.</p>

<p>Whilst we aim to have both parties sign this contract to confirm their agreement to it, we recognise this is not always possible. In this instance, a clear written confirmation (via email or otherwise) of agreement to the contract and its adjoining terms &amp; conditions, along with payment of the initial deposit; shall constitute commencement of the contract and a contractual agreement between the client and Tactically Creative shall exist based on the quotation with its specifications and these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>Tactically Creative cannot always guarantee to start work immediately on a project but will arrange a date with the client as to when work can commence. An anticipated finishing date will be agreed and Tactically Creative will endeavour to adhere to it, but cannot guarantee to do so in the light of circumstances outside of our control.</p>

<p>Where in the instance that a time scale has been agreed, Tactically Creative will not be responsible for any consequential losses to the client if the deadline is not met.</p>

<h3 id="2-our-process:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">2 - Our Process</h3>

<p>We will work with you closely in a collaborative process from the very start of the project. Much of our work requires us to have an intimate knowledge of your products or services, and the goals you want to achieve.</p>

<p>As we work in a collaborative, ‘Agile’ manner, we require that you are available to work directly with us on a number of occasions. Our style of work means that we work together ‘with you’, rather than ‘for you’; which ultimately will lead to greater benefits for your business.</p>

<p>Whilst this style of project can produce brilliant results, it can be very hard to distinguish developments of an idea that is within scope, from a change or new feature that exists outside our agreement. When this occurs, we will make you aware of the feature or change that we feel falls outside our agreement before starting work on it; and offer to include it as part of a change order.</p>

<p>When a particular element, feature or functionality within our agreement requires lots of ongoing development and refinement beyond what could be considered reasonable, we will propose a process where we discuss and re-evaluate the item that is causing delays. This is to either clarify our understanding of the item’s purpose, or to ascertain whether it is actually necessary at all!</p>

<p>As you can see, this process is not one where you are given a set number of revisions, limited opportunities to provide feedback and instruct us what to do. A fluid process such as ours, with so many opportunities for discussion, collaboration and ongoing amendments, which can become grey areas; is unfortunately open to abuse if either party is unreasonable. We ask that when working with us, you are fair, reasonable and honest with your requests; and we shall do the same.</p>

<p>Once the project meets the specification within the contract, it is deemed ‘complete’; and any further amendments to the product (design, functionality or otherwise) will be at the discretion of Tactically Creative if a maintenance agreement is not present. It is at this point that any remaining balance for the project is due.</p>

<p>Once a project is complete and total payment has been made, we will make the production files available to you, or alternatively upload them to your public server. Until that time, and whilst we are working on them, your website and its updates will be available for review on our development server only.</p>

<h3 id="3-change-orders:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">3 - Change Orders</h3>

<p>As mentioned above, if you decide on additional work outside of our existing agreement; we will draw up a change order. This will definitively list the changes or additions to our pre-existing arrangement, the associated cost involved and adjusted deadlines. Both parties must agree to this change order, either by signing, or confirming their agreement in writing as detailed above.</p>

<p>It should be noted that maintenance and service agreements are not subject to change orders, and remain binding for the predetermined period set out in the specific contract.</p>

<h3 id="4-services:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">4 - Services</h3>

<p>Tactically Creative also offer a number of ongoing services in addition to the ‘Projects’ we undertake for the client. These rolling services are ‘Website Maintenance’, ‘Website Hosting’ &amp; ‘A/B Testing’. Each of these services are subject to their own, separate contracts; and unless an agreement is made specifically for any of these services, they are not included within a Project.</p>

<p>Tactically Creative require that the client commits to an initial three month period of provision for each service. Once this initial three month period has passed, the arrangement continues on a monthly, rolling basis.</p>

<p>Payment for the initial three month period must be made in advance, before the service in question shall be provided. Payments thereafter, are due one month in advance.</p>

<p><em>For example, payment for services running 1 April - 30 April shall be due on 1 March.</em></p>

<p>Failure to make this payment within our standard 30 day period, shall result in a suspension of the client’s service. Tactically Creative reserve the right at our sole and absolute discretion to withdraw any services that we would otherwise be obliged to provide; when payment has not been made.</p>

<p>If the client wishes to cancel a service, they will be required to give at least one months notice in writing (email is acceptable) to Tactically Creative. They will however be entitled to continue using the provided service until the end of the period that has been paid for.</p>

<p><em>Using the above example, if the payment was due on 1 March for services running 1 April - 30 April, the client must inform Tactically Creative that they wish to cancel before 31 March. They will however be entitled to the use of the service until 30 April</em></p>

<p>Where the client wises to cancel a service within the initial three month period, it is understood that the client is not entitled to a refund, partial or otherwise; but are entitled to continue using the service until the end of the three month window.</p>

<p>Where Tactically Creative cancels a service contract other than for a reason set out in Cancellation and Termination below, a refund equivalent to the unused portion of the current payment period will be the maximum liability.</p>

<h4 id="4-1-website-maintenance:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">4.1 - Website Maintenance</h4>

<p>Where Tactically Creative undertakes to maintain or update a client’s website; a suitable system of communication shall be established to allow for the ongoing development of the client’s site. The specific details of the work that Tactically Creative will carry out as part of this agreement will be listed in the specific contract pertaining to ongoing maintenance.</p>

<p>In instances where the client does not come to a web site management agreement it is the sole responsibility of the client to manage the site. Tactically Creative will no longer be responsible for the site upon completion unless an alternative agreement has been reached. In the absence of a maintenance agreement, Tactically Creative will fix all errors notified to us in writing within thirty days of the site being put live on the Internet. If errors are reported after more than thirty days, the time and costs involved in making such changes will be charged to the client.</p>

<h4 id="4-2-website-hosting:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">4.2 - Website Hosting</h4>

<p>Tactically Creative provide a hosting service for all our clients, past and present. This hosting service is usually part of an ongoing maintenance agreement, however it is also offered in isolation as a stand-alone service. This hosting shall be on Tactically Creative’s own VPS, supplied by Digital Ocean.</p>

<p>When hosting is supplied by Tactically Creative to the client as a stand-alone service, it should not be confused with a maintenance agreement. The client remains solely responsible for the management of the site. Tactically Creative shall only be responsible for the maintenance of our server.</p>

<h4 id="4-3-a-b-testing:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">4.3 - A/B Testing</h4>

<p>All arrangements for the provision of A/B testing supplied by Tactically Creative to the client shall be specified in an individual contract. The arrangement is subject to all the T&amp;Cs in this document, and the same payment and period of cancellation as our other services, such as ‘Website Maintenance’ and ‘Website Hosting’ listed above.</p>

<h3 id="5-payment:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">5 - Payment</h3>

<p>Payment terms are strictly 30 days unless otherwise agreed in writing beforehand. Whilst any payment due under the agreement remains outstanding, Tactically Creative shall be entitled at our sole and absolute discretion to withdraw provision of any goods or services we would otherwise be obliged to provide under the agreement. Tactically Creative expects payment by electronic bank transfer or online payment within 30 days from the date of invoice.</p>

<p>Payments may be made in Euros or US Dollars, provided this has been agreed in advance, and a sum sufficient to cover exchange commission, charges and any other additional expenses incurred has been added to the amount due.</p>

<p>In accordance with the Late Payment of Commercial Debts Act 1998, interest will be charged on all payments received outside of payment terms at the rate of eight per cent above the Bank of England Base Rate as applicable on the previous 31 December or 30 June whichever is the most recent. In case collection proves necessary, the client agrees to pay all fees (including all legal fees and court costs) incurred by that process.</p>

<p>If for any reason whatsoever we are unable to provide an agreed upon product or service in accordance with these terms and conditions, our liability shall be limited in its entirety to a proportional refund of any fees paid by you for the service or product.</p>

<h3 id="6-unforeseen-additional-costs-or-expenses:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">6 - Unforeseen &amp; Additional Costs or Expenses</h3>

<p>The transfer of domain names to another server can sometimes become a complex and time consuming matter. All administrative fees to third parties and the time taken to organise the transfer will be charged to the client irrespective of any quoted amount set out in the quotation with its specifications.</p>

<p>Additional costs incurred in the provision of: stock photography; electronic commerce software; online transaction processing solutions; domain name registration; web space; Internet connection provided by third parties are non refundable.</p>

<h3 id="7-copyright:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">7 - Copyright</h3>

<p>First, the client guarantees that all elements of text, images or other artwork they provide are either owned by themselves, or that they’ve permission to use them from the rightful owner.</p>

<p>When the client’s final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:
-The client will own the visual elements that Tactically Creative creates for this project. TC will give the client finished files and the client should keep them somewhere safe as Tactically Creative is not required to keep a copy.
-The client will own all elements of text, images and data they provided, unless a third-party owns them.
-Tactically Creative will own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and will license that to the client, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless agreed otherwise. It should be noted that Tactically Creative reserve the right to use any code written throughout any of our projects, elsewhere on the understanding that the result is visually distinct from the original.
-Tactically Creative loves to show off our work and share what we’ve learned with other people, so we reserve the right, with the client’s permission, to display and link to the client’s project as part of our portfolio and to write about it on websites, in magazine articles and in books.</p>

<h3 id="8-domain-name-research-registration:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">8 - Domain Name Research &amp; Registration</h3>

<p>It is the responsibility of the client to provide the domain name for their website at a registrar of their own choosing. Tactically Creative can advise on this matter. Tactically Creative shall be granted access to the client’s domain name registrar for the purposes of assigning the DNS to the appropriate servers. This will result in any previously setup email addresses on that domain not working. If this is the case, Tactically Creative can, although shall not be obliged to; assist with setting up new email accounts for the domain as per below (Section 9).</p>

<h3 id="9-email:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">9 - Email</h3>

<p>Whilst Tactically Creative may be responsible for the hosting and maintenance of the site, TC are not responsible for any email accounts associated to the client’s domain name. The setup, management and ongoing maintenance of any emails are the client’s sole responsibility. Tactically Creative can advise the client on how best to setup email services, and can assist with this process if Tactically Creative are responsible for the domain’s DNS as per above (Section 8)</p>

<h3 id="10-sub-contracting:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">10 - Sub-Contracting</h3>

<p>If necessary Tactically Creative reserves the right, and the client hereby agrees, to allow the use of sub-contractors or agents to work on any aspect of the design or website.</p>

<h3 id="11-consequential-losses:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">11 - Consequential Losses</h3>

<p>If for any reason whatsoever Tactically Creative is unable to provide an agreed product or service in accordance with these terms and conditions, our liability shall be limited in its entirety to a proportional refund of any fees paid by you for the service or product. The entire risk as to the quality and performance of the website or other services is with the client. In no event will Tactically Creative be liable to the client or any third party for any damages, including, but not limited to, service interruptions caused by acts of god, the hosting service or any other circumstances beyond the control of Tactically Creative, any lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential, punitive, or special damages arising out of the operation of or inability to operate the website or other services, failure of any service provider, of any telecommunications carrier, of the Internet backbone, of any Internet servers, your or your site visitors&rsquo; computer or Internet software, even if Tactically Creative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.</p>

<h3 id="12-advice-and-consultancy:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">12 - Advice and Consultancy</h3>

<p>Any advice given in respect of software, hardware, programming, design, purchasing, hosting, training, upgrading, installing or any other advice, suggestion, recommendation or otherwise of any product or service provided by us or by a third party, whether introduced by us directly or indirectly is accepted by you as an opinion. You further agree to indemnify us of all liability with regard to any decision or action performed by you that may or may not be a direct or indirect result of any contact or dealing with us.</p>

<p>Our consultancy service and general advice is, by its nature, subjective. It is up to you whether you decide to follow our ideas and suggestions. It is not possible and we do not guarantee that any of those ideas and suggestions will increase traffic to your site, improve your ratings with search engines or boost sales.</p>

<h3 id="13-training:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">13 - Training</h3>

<p>Tactically Creative endeavour to provide appropriate training where appropriate. The outcomes of training personnel in whatever activities agreed, are not readily quantifiable and as such we cannot accept liability for any training we provide not meeting the client’s or the trainee’s expectations.</p>

<h3 id="14-right-to-assign:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">14 - Right to Assign</h3>

<p>This Agreement is personal to the client and they may not assign it without our prior express written consent. Should the client transfer ownership of the website as part of a transfer of ownership of a business then the new owners will need to come to a new agreement with Tactically Creative.</p>

<p>### 15 - Communication</p>

<p>Tactically Creative’s preferred method of communication is by email. Invoices and quotes will be sent by email and shall form a legal document just as if sent by traditional post.</p>

<p>The design process will be undertaken in person if possible or by Skype conferencing, sample Internet design publication on Tactically Creative’s website, or any other method as appropriate to the client’s particular circumstances.</p>

<h3 id="16-cancellation-and-termination:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">16 - Cancellation and Termination</h3>

<p>Tactically Creative may, by written notice, terminate the Agreement between us &amp; the client immediately upon the happening of any of the following events. * The client fails to pay any invoice which has become due. * The client commits a material breach of any of the terms of the Agreement between us &amp; them. * The client enters into or proposes a voluntary arrangement or composition with their creditors or reconstruction of their debts or their directors make a declaration of solvency for the purpose of a members&rsquo; voluntary winding up, or if notice is given of a creditors&rsquo; meeting in connection with a creditors&rsquo; winding up, or if a special resolution is passed that they be wound up by the court, or if an administrative or other receiver is appointed, or if the court makes and administration order or order that they be wound up by the court, or if they cease to carry on business or are unable to pay their debts within the meaning of the Insolvency Act 1986 Section 123.</p>

<p>We reserve the right to remove from the Internet any website or other service which we display on the client’s behalf upon the occurrence of one of the above circumstances.</p>

<p>Should we terminate the Agreement upon the occurrence of one of the above circumstances, we will not refund any monies paid by the client to us. If at any point during a Project the client wishes to cancel, they may do so but will be invoiced up to the full amount quoted based on the degree to which the work has been completed and on the extent to which time has been allocated to the project that cannot be effectively used to generate revenue that would be otherwise lost.</p>

<p>In the event that Tactically Creative terminates a service contract for any other reason, a refund equivalent to the unused portion of the current payment period will be the maximum liability.</p>

<h3 id="17-waiver-and-interpretation:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">17 - Waiver and Interpretation</h3>

<p>Should Tactically Creative waive any of these terms on an individual basis, this shall not affect the validity of remaining clauses or commit Tactically Creative to waive the same clause on any other occasion.</p>

Any variation to these terms and conditions shall be inapplicable unless agreed between us &amp; the client before we commence any work on their behalf.</p>

<p>Work, services or products are only supplied in strict accordance with these terms and conditions.</p>

<p>The provision of work, services or products by us is only undertaken on the understanding that the client has read and accepted these terms and conditions in full.</p>

<p>By agreeing to these terms and conditions the clients statutory rights are not affected.</p>

<p>This contract shall be subject to English Law. In the event that Tactically Creative is not entitled to rely on a term or terms in this contract, then Tactically Creative may also be allowed to cancel all rights and obligations under this contract, or to hold all other clauses as valid entirely at their sole discretion.</p>

<p>No terms or conditions endorsed upon, delivered with or contained in the client’s purchase order, confirmation of order, specification or other document will form part of the contract simply as a result of such document being referred to in the contract.</p>

<p>The client must ensure that the terms of its order and any applicable specification are complete and accurate.</p>

<h3 id="18-confidentiality:9b10c1f64082d3869fd4cb1f85809430">18 - Confidentiality</h3>
