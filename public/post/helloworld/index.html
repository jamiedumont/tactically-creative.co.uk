<p>Those two immortal words that any developer will know instantly. They symbolise every coffee-fuelled <em>&lsquo;Eureka&rsquo;</em> moment and every knowing <em>&lsquo;A-Ha!&rsquo;</em>. They represent learning, understanding and success.</p>

<h2 id="fact-1:b0550240c0a1b7c12779ff8220a94c0f">Fact #1</h2>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Hello World&rsquo;</em> first came about when Brian Kernighan instructed would-be programmers on how to create a simple program, whose only purpose is to output those two little words. The phrase originates from a passage in his book; <em>&lsquo;A Tutorial to the Language B&rsquo;</em>. That was in 1972, and since then, <em>&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;</em> has come represent many programmers and developers first steps.</p>

<p>It has become the de-facto result that novices create when learning basic computer science principles, or even when experienced professionals are learning a new language. It is the proof of concept, and a gateway to ever-increasing knowledge.</p>

<p>I remember my first <em>&lsquo;HW&rsquo;</em> was written in Visual Basic, which my uncle taught me as a child. Once I had that cracked, it was a short step to building a calculator, mimicking Microsoft&rsquo;s own; and then onto larger, complex database driven systems. That <em>&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;</em> became the starting point for the rest of my professional life!</p>

<h2 id="fact-2:b0550240c0a1b7c12779ff8220a94c0f">Fact #2</h2>

<h4 id="tactically-creative-is-here:b0550240c0a1b7c12779ff8220a94c0f">Tactically Creative is here!</h4>

<p>Whilst Tactically Creative has only officially been around for a few months, this moment has been a long time coming! About two years ago, I set out with a mission of making websites for small businesses easier to use, less of a productivity blackhole and far more cost effective. I wanted people to *gasp* enjoy building their website again, rather than dreading the mine-field of publishing new content and making changes.</p>

<p>Today, Tactically Creative exists to make building and maintaining your business website a breeze, and also fun again! We focus specifically on developing static sites and web apps that provide huge advantages over the go-to solution of Wordpress or similar CMS. We believe that static sites are increasingly the best solution for many businesses, and whilst that idea swims against the current; we&rsquo;re here to show you that the status-quo isn&rsquo;t all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be!</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s to <em>&lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;</em>!</p>
