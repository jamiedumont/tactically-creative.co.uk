<h2 id="how-has-this-happened:774e757a50a2b25ab233124fd503800c">How has this happened?</h2>

<p>First I&rsquo;ll start with a short side-note, but a relevant one! It&rsquo;s plain to see that this site hasn&rsquo;t seen an update in quite a while. I&rsquo;m sure most other developers will agree that their own site often goes neglected, sometimes for years at a time! Working on your own site can be hard to prioritise when you spend all day starring at a screen.</p>

<p>So what stirred me from my slumber? How, after 6 months of not posting, did I muster some hastily cobbled together words on a Saturday evening? What prompted such a reaction, and why was Twitter not enough of an outlet?</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll tell you: I realised that &ldquo;Web Developers&rdquo; are screwed.</p>

<h2 id="really:774e757a50a2b25ab233124fd503800c">Really?</h2>

<p>Yes, really! I&rsquo;m not talking about myself, or any of you out there that already convert the coffee in your bloodstream to code on the screen; and thus money in the bank. I&rsquo;m talking about &ldquo;Web Developers&rdquo; as a whole, because when viewed through a proper perspective; those previously or currently building things with code are a miniscule percentage of those that <em>will go on to</em> build something with code.</p>

<p>That means that the people who will be building our technological future have to wade through bullshit like this <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&amp;rls=en&amp;q=development+languages+and+their+best+uses&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;oe=UTF-8&amp;gfe_rd=cr&amp;ei=Cf2jVo31FcyFOvC-u6gN">page</a> of Google results.</p>

<h2 id="an-innocent-question:774e757a50a2b25ab233124fd503800c">An innocent question</h2>

<p>I recently had someone wanting to get into development ask me the perfectly innocent and fair question: <em>&ldquo;Where should I start?&rdquo;</em> Trawling my brain, I remembered a good (albeit, old) infographic breaking down the main options. To Google&rsquo;s credit, that infographic was in my list of results; but so were some newer articles. This is where it all went wrong!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll spare the long rant, as I already feel like the grumpy old man telling the kids to get off his grass; but there enough articles that follow the &ldquo;Top {i} Languages for {year}&rdquo; formula for my heart to sink. When I opened them up, my fears were concerned. All were link bait, all consisted of generic, uninformed content. I&rsquo;m surprised I didn&rsquo;t see: <strong>&ldquo;His boss hates him! Developer reinvents the internet with this one weird trick!&rdquo;</strong></p>

<h2 id="preventing-confusion:774e757a50a2b25ab233124fd503800c">Preventing confusion</h2>

<p>I don&rsquo;t have a problem with this sort of psuedo-informative style of writing in principle. It obviously get hits, which I&rsquo;ve decided to test with this page&rsquo;s title. The issue is when someone with little knowledge can&rsquo;t distinguish between sound advice, and hyperbole based on the flavour of the month. I know when I started out, my options were confusing enough, and that was when I was trying to learn standardised, stable languages. The constantly shifting landscape of the <del>current</del> development world makes it hard enough without the fanboy lists of &ldquo;Hot new shiny!&rdquo;</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m disappointed that &ldquo;Listicles&rdquo; have made their way into once-useful journalism. I&rsquo;ve made a note to check the magazine my Doctor reads next time I go to see her, just in case she&rsquo;s learning about &ldquo;6 treatments your patients will love this month&rdquo;.</p>

<p><em>Sigh&hellip;</em></p>
