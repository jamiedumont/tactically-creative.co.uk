<h2 id="a-brilliant-evening:c9033999b9835a7dfef93e5745ed10aa">A Brilliant Evening!</h2>

<p>First of all, I&rsquo;d like to send a big <strong>&lsquo;Thank You!&rsquo;</strong> to Chris, Rob &amp; Heena who did a wonderful job organising a brilliant event.</p>

<p>The online <a href="http://fizzle.co/?aid=8451">Fizzle</a> community is a wonderful resource, full of amazing people doing amazing things; but it really comes to life when you meet these people in person. It was a great honour to be asked to speak in front of them, and share my knowledge of building websites.</p>

<p>Building a website is the cornerstone for any online entrepreneur, and it&rsquo;s relevance is becoming greater as time passes. However, there&rsquo;s a lot of information out there, which can make the process utterly confusing to the uninitiated. The problem isn&rsquo;t the volume of information though, it&rsquo;s the &lsquo;noise&rsquo; within. There&rsquo;s a lot of good advice (signal) and a lot of terrible or irrelevant advice (noise), and separating them can be tricky.</p>

<p>My talk aimed to cut through the noise and deliver a small dose of signal to get everyone started. I decided to write my talk up to serve as a point of reference to everyone there. It has the same content as my talk, plus a bit more. I&rsquo;ve included more advice, along with links to what I feel are the most relevant, and important articles out there for anyone building a website.</p>

<p>The site can be found here: <a href="http://fizzle-london.netlify.com">On the Creation of Websites</a></p>

<h2 id="my-line-in-the-sand:c9033999b9835a7dfef93e5745ed10aa">My line in the sand</h2>

<p>As you may have read in my casestudies, I&rsquo;ve moved away from Content Management Systems like Wordpress for my client work, and have other systems (namely static solutions) that I feel are more suitable. I brought this up during my talk, as <em>not</em> talking about technology and platforms was going to tough to avoid. When Wordpress came up, and I spoke about how I don&rsquo;t feel it&rsquo;s the most practical option anymore, I received a healthy dose of skepticism from some of the guys there who use Wordpress themselves. I completely expected that, but the insights that came from the resulting debate were interesting.</p>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t actually sat down and had this discussion with <em>other developers</em> before, so it was nice to get into a bit of a debate about the pro&rsquo;s and con&rsquo;s of each option. We know how fervently a developer can defend their platform/language/text editor of choice. We&rsquo;re almost fanatical about our beliefs. Having to justify why I&rsquo;ve abandoned an industry standard like Wordpress and shy away from the heavy-handed contracts that most designers/developers use was a really healthy thing for me to do.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s clear that I&rsquo;ve drawn my line in the sand, and <strong>I offer what I truly believe to be the best service I can</strong> for my clients. That&rsquo;s required me to approach problems differently and look beyond the obvious solutions. This goes against the grain, and I&rsquo;m comfortable with that, because I believe in what I&rsquo;m offering.</p>
