## A Brilliant Evening!

First of all, I'd like to send a big **'Thank You!'** to Chris, Rob & Heena who did a wonderful job organising a brilliant event.

The online [Fizzle](http://fizzle.co/?aid=8451) community is a wonderful resourse, full of amazing people doing amazing things; but it really comes to life when you meet these people in person. It was a great honour to be asked to speak in front of them, and share my knowledge of building websites.

Building a website is the cornerstone for any online entrepreneur, and it's relevance is becoming greater as time passes. However, there's a lot of information out there, which can make the process utterly confusing to the uninitiated. The problem isn't the volume of information though, it's the 'noise' within. There's a lot of good advice (signal) and a lot of terrible or irrelevant advice (noise), and separating them can be tricky.

My talk aimed to cut through the noise and deliver a small dose of signal to get everyone started. I decided to write my talk up to serve as a point of reference to everyone there. It has the same content as my talk, plus a bit more. I've included more advice, along with links to what I feel are the most relevant, and important articles out there for anyone building a website.
