Those two immortal words that any developer will know instantly. They symbolise every coffee-fuelled *'Eureka'* moment and every knowing *'A-Ha!'*. They represent learning, understanding and success.

## Fact #1
'*Hello World'* first came about when Brian Kernighan instructed would-be programmers on how to create a simple program, whose only purpose is to output those two little words. The phrase originates from a passage in his book; *'A Tutorial to the Language B'*. That was in 1972, and since then, *'Hello World'* has come represent many programmers and developers first steps.

It has become the de-facto result that novices create when learning basic computer science principles, or even when experienced professionals are learning a new language. It is the proof of concept, and a gateway to ever-increasing knowledge. 

I remember my first *'HW'* was written in Visual Basic, which my uncle taught me as a child. Once I had that cracked, it was a short step to building a calculator, mimicking Microsoft's own; and then onto larger, complex database driven systems. That *'Hello World'* became the starting point for the rest of my professional life!

## Fact #2
#### Tactically Creative is here!
Whilst Tactically Creative has only officially been around for a few months, this moment has been a long time coming! About two years ago, I set out with a mission of making websites for small businesses easier to use, less of a productivity blackhole and far more cost effective. I wanted people to \*gasp\* enjoy building their website again, rather than dreading the mine-field of publishing new content and making changes.

Today, Tactically Creative exists to make building and maintaining your business website a breeze, and also fun again! We focus specifically on developing static sites and web apps that provide huge advantages over the go-to solution of Wordpress or similar CMS. We believe that static sites are increasingly the best solution for many businesses, and whilst that idea swims against the current; we're here to show you that the status-quo isn't all it's cracked up to be!

Here's to *'Hello World'*!
