## How has this happened?

First I'll start with a short side-note, but a relevant one! It's plain to see that this site hasn't seen an update in quite a while. I'm sure most other developers will agree that their own site often goes neglected, sometimes for years at a time! Working on your own site can be hard to prioritise when you spend all day starring at a screen.

So what stirred me from my slumber? How, after 6 months of not posting, did I muster some hastily cobbled together words on a Saturday evening? What prompted such a reaction, and why was Twitter not enough of an outlet?

I'll tell you: I realised that "Web Developers" are screwed.

## Really?

Yes, really! I'm not talking about myself, or any of you out there that already convert the coffee in your bloodstream to code on the screen; and thus money in the bank. I'm talking about "Web Developers" as a whole, because when viewed through a proper perspective; those previously or currently building things with code are a miniscule percentage of those that *will go on to* build something with code.

That means that the people who will be building our technological future have to wade through bullshit like this [page](https://www.google.co.uk/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=development+languages+and+their+best+uses&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&gfe_rd=cr&ei=Cf2jVo31FcyFOvC-u6gN) of Google results.

## An innocent question

I recently had someone wanting to get into development ask me the perfectly innocent and fair question: *"Where should I start?"* Trawling my brain, I remembered a good (albeit, old) infographic breaking down the main options. To Google's credit, that infographic was in my list of results; but so were some newer articles. This is where it all went wrong!

I'll spare the long rant, as I already feel like the grumpy old man telling the kids to get off his grass; but there enough articles that follow the "Top {i} Languages for {year}" formula for my heart to sink. When I opened them up, my fears were concerned. All were link bait, all consisted of generic, uninformed content. I'm surprised I didn't see: **"His boss hates him! Developer reinvents the internet with this one weird trick!"**

## Preventing confusion

I don't have a problem with this sort of psuedo-informative style of writing in principle. It obviously get hits, which I've decided to test with this page's title. The issue is when someone with little knowledge can't distinguish between sound advice, and hyperbole based on the flavour of the month. I know when I started out, my options were confusing enough, and that was when I was trying to learn standardised, stable languages. The constantly shifting landscape of the ~~current~~ development world makes it hard enough without the fanboy lists of "Hot new shiny!"

I'm disappointed that "Listicles" have made their way into once-useful journalism. I've made a note to check the magazine my Doctor reads next time I go to see her, just in case she's learning about "6 treatments your patients will love this month".

*Sigh...*
