Working with Tactically Creative is a different experience for many of our new clients, so we try to make it as easy as possible to get started. We hope that by explaining our Ethos, we can help you understand why we do many of the things the way that we do.

At TC, we value two ideals above everything else: genuine progress and genuine relationships.

## Genuine Progress

We measure progress by what we produce, not by the time spent working on it. We believe in building something tangible, testing it and refining it. We don't believe in long meetings, trying to scope the unknown or in "being busy".

### How to define and strive for "Genuine Progress"?

The phrase "I'm busy" has become the de-facto statement to convey how important you are, and how hard you work. It also seems to be understood that "being busy" directly equates to positive action and accomplishments.

Wrong! Progress is measured by the results you produce, and the objectives you accomplish; not by taking part in the process that got you there. We aim to work smarter, not harder! We believe that "being busy" is a sign you're not in control of your project.

Every business has objectives (or it should!) but no one seems to hold their website to the same standard. A website should have objectives, and we don't believe that endless meetings and scoping documents contribute towards meeting these targets.

Ideas and strategies that are quickly turned into living, working code and can be immediately implemented, tested and refined are our marker for genuine progress.

We believe that objective based design and development is the best way to tackle complex projects like websites. Working backwards from your end game and creating a roadmap to follow, you can create a series of milestones. 

Tackling smaller chunks allows us to develop different strategies, experiment, and try out ideas. We can explore multiple ways of reaching your objectives, reviewing the data as we go and definitively being able to say what works and what doesn't; rather than spend a life time speculating in yet another scoping meeting...

## Genuine Relationships

We feel an open, honest and trusting collaboration breeds the best results (and we're all about results). Working relationships shouldn't stop looking like friendships because there's money involved.

### What this collaboration actually means...

I personally treat every client as a friend, which allows us to develop the trusting and honest relationships needed to make the flexible nature of our projects work. We always work together to each others mutual benefit. There's no heavy-handed contracts, no retainers and no funny business. Not everyone will feel comfortable with such a flexible arrangement, and I completely understand. I work this way because not only are the results exponentially better, we have great fun and make life-long friends on these projects. I feel this is the way business *should* be done, even though it rarely is.

## We're different by design

When setting up Tactically Creative, I wanted to improve how websites are built. The pursuit  of that ideal extended to the process and the team involved, and not just the end result. By defining an Ethos for how I believe design, but also business, should be done; I was able to draw my line in the sand. I've been able to build something that I'm incredibly proud of, that remains true to myself and my intentions.
