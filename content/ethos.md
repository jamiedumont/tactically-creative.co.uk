Working with Tactically Creative is a different experience for many of our new clients, because we hold two values above everything else: genuine progress and genuine relationships.

### Genuine Progress

We don't believe in long meetings, trying to scope the unknown or in "being busy". The phrase "I'm busy" has become the de-facto statement to convey how important you are, and how hard you work. It also seems to be understood that "being busy" directly equates to positive action and accomplishments.

Instead, we believe progress is measured by the results you produce, and the objectives you accomplish; not by taking part in the process that got you there. We aim to work smarter, not harder! We believe that "being busy" is a sign you're not in control of your project.

We chose to implement Objective Based Design for this sole reason, because it makes allowances for the complex nature of projects such as websites and software.

### Genuine Relationships

We feel an open, honest and trusting collaboration breeds the best results . Working relationships shouldn't stop looking like friendships because there's money involved.

We approach every new client as a new friendship, as this allows us to make the flexible nature of our projects work. There's no heavy-handed contracts, no retainers and no funny business.

Not everyone will feel comfortable with such a flexible arrangement, and we completely understand. We work this way because not only are the results exponentially better, we have great fun and make life-long friends on these projects.

We feel this is how service relationships *should* work, even though they rarely do.
